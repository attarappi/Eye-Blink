# Eye Blink Detection

Eye blink was build for one of the core functionalities of [Aether](https://github.com/samiurprapon/Aether). Later on, I copied the code and made it a standalone project.

## Story

I never open this repository after I open-sourced it until one day (`Back then, I was emotionally broken and trying to find a reason to live. At some point in our life, we've all been there, right?`) [a person](https://github.com/samiurprapon/Eye-Blink-Detection/issues/1) reached out over messenger and told me that he used this code in one of his project. I was surprised and happy at the same time. I never expected anyone from the internet to reach out and thank me for this code, especially since it doesn't even have a basic README file!

After debugging life for another two years, I decided to preserve this little happiness, and the perfect place to do so is right here in this README file.

And just before writing this README file, I updated the code to make it compatible with `Android 10`.
